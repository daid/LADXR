<h1>LADXR: Frequently asked questions</h1>

<h3>How do I get the right ROM?</h3>
<p>For legal reasons, we can only tell you to get an official cartridge, and dump the rom from an official cart with a cartridge dumper.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a cartridge dumper, <a href="https://www.gbxcart.com/">GBxCart RW</a> is relatively cheap, and known to be good & safe.</p>

<h3>How do I know that I have the correct version of the ROM?</h3>
<p>If you know how to use hashes, you need the English v1.0 ROM for Links Awakening DX. The SHA-1 for it is "d90ac17e9bf17b6c61624ad9f05447bdb5efc01a".</p>
<br />
<p>If the above was greek to you, please read the below section.</p>
<br />
<p>First off, it needs to be English. Next, you need it on v1.0. The quickest way to check this is in the library (below Mabe well/the forest entrance).</p>
<p>In this library, if the book on top of the bookshelf has a shadow, it's v1.0; else it is a newer version, and you have the wrong version. If there is no book, you have the GameBoy version, you need the DX (GameBoy Color) version.</p>

<h3>Why do I get a screen with BAD EMU?</h3>
<p>Stop using VisualBoyAdvance. It's a horrible emulator, it even causes random bugs in the vanilla game. Use:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bgb.bircd.org/">BGB</a>: Excelent emulator. But only available on windows. Speedruns usually require this emulator.</li>
<li><a href="https://sameboy.github.io/">SameBoy</a>: Very accurate emulator. Great on MacOS. The UI is less friendly on Windows/Linux.</li>
<li><a href="https://emulicious.net/">Emulicious</a>: Accurate, lots of features.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.retroarch.com/">RetroArch</a>: If you use Android there are not many options. RetroArch with the SameBoy core is your best option. Most emulators on Android are horrible.</li>
<li><a href="https://mgba.io/">mGBA</a>: <em>Accurate enough</em> GBC emulation to not cause problems. Use something else if you can.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Do I need to use glitches/bugs?</h3>
<p>No, all skill levels are welcome. The default settings can require that you do a few obscure things, like killing enemies with bombs, and dropping down one way ledges. There is a casual logic setting that will remove these requirements and make it easier.</p>
<p>It is expected that you know where all the <a href="https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/Link%27s_Awakening_Heart_Pieces_(Game_Boy)">heart pieces</a> are hidden, and the <a href="https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/Link%27s_Awakening_Secret_Seashells_(Game_Boy)">hidden secret seashells</a>.</p>
<p>There is a setting for glitched logic, which will require the use of glitches to progress. A full list of these is maintained at the <a href="https://discord.gg/XTw7X2G">discord</a> channel.</p>

<h3>I found an issue?</h3>
<p>It is possible. Reach out on <a href="https://discord.gg/XTw7X2G">discord</a>, or at the <a href="https://github.com/daid/LADXR/issues">Github issue tracker</a>.</p>

<h3>I found both red and blue tunic?</h3>
<p>That is by design, you can switch tunic between your options at a phone booth. If you have an tunic color override, you can see your current tunic in the [SELECT] menu inside your inventory screen.</p>

<h3>The rooster is not working?</h3>
<p>Rooster wasn't available pre-v10, as it had left you after completing D7: making it possible to lock yourself out of the Bird Key location. To prevent this, the Bird Key cave is modified to be accessible with a L2 Power Bracelet, and Rooster is a permanent item.</p>

<h3>What is up with the trade quest?</h3>
<p>By default, each member of the trade quest will give you an item if you show them what they want. They are decoupled from eachother, and you can have all of the items at the same time.</p>

<h3>I found a single arrow?</h3>
<p>It's a wink towards the <a href="https://alttpr.com/">A Link to the Past randomizer</a>, where there is also a single arrow chest shuffled with the items.</p>

<h3>Hard/Glitched/Hell logic is impossible!</h3>
<p>Drop in our <a href="https://discord.gg/XTw7X2G">discord</a>. These options are for really advanced players, and require a lot of in-depth game knowledge. Don't use this option unless you really know what you are doing.</p>

<h3>What is this Multiworld I hear about?</h3>
<p>It allows two or more people to play together: items are shuffled between multiple players' games, and you will find another persons' items. The setup is complex and requires a specific emulator. As always, drop by <a href="https://discord.gg/XTw7X2G">discord</a>. We can help you out there, or even play with you.</p>

<h3>How do I make custom graphics?</h3>
<p>Changing the graphics requires editing the <a href="https://github.com/daid/LADXR/raw/master/gfx/template.png">graphics template</a>. You can use this for the "Custom..." option in the graphics selection to load the modified file.</p>

<h3 id="plando">How does the plandomizer work?</h3>
<p>LADXR accepts a plan file that allows manual placement of items at specific locations. Any locations that aren't explicitly set are randomly filled in with items from the pool specified in the plan file, respecting logic as usual.</p>
<p>Plan files can be created manually by filling in an <a href="plan-template.txt">empty template</a>, or <a href="https://magpietracker.us/">Magpie</a> allows a plan file to be exported after items are graphically assigned to checks.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://ladxr.daid.eu/latest/plando.html">separate page</a> is used to generate seeds with plan files.</p>
