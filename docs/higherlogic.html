<h1>So, you want to play non-casual?</h1>
<h6>(A brief guide to the tricks used in both Hard and Glitched, written by <a href="https://github.com/foxsouns">fox</a>.)</h5>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>You'll want to familarize yourself with the <a href="https://github.com/daid/LADXR/tree/master/logic">logic files</a> of the randomizer: the comments are typically descriptive enough to figure out what trick you are supposed to use. And, if you aren't already, I highly recommend playing on <a href="http://ladxr.daid.eu/latest/">latest</a>. The benefits overweigh the downsides.</p>
<br />
<br />
<h2>Hard Logic</h2>
<p>Hard logic is basically Normal logic, except, well, a little harder! Not to worry: there isn't a whole lot to cover.</p>
<br />
<h3>Clipping</h3>
<p>At the corner of a block, it is possible to walk into the wall a few pixels more than usual, and continue walking with those extra pixels. There are a few cases where you can bypass enemies or reach hard-to-reach areas with those extra pixels.</p>
<h3>Feather Tech</h3>
<p>There's a handful of spots that you can jump across with just tricky feather jumps.</p>
<h3>Boots Tech</h3>
<p>You can skip the flamethrower cave using just Boots and a Medicine: you want to ram into the fire until the medicine activates, and then run through the fire with the invincibility frames.</p>
<h3>Boots Jumping (Feather & Boots)</h3>
<p>There are several places where you can reach hard-to-reach areas using the longer jump provided by equiping both boots and feather, dashing with boots, then jumping.</p>
<h3>Hookshot tech</h3>
<p>There are a few places where you can get over pits with some tricky uses of hookshot, like the sign below Write's Hut, and the like.</p>
<p>While clipped, it's possible to reach an item on the other side using hookshot.</p>
<h3>Boomerang Tech</h3>
<p>While clipped, it's possible to reach an item on the other side using boomerang.</p>
<p>You can kill and grab the item from Kanalet's Ball & Chain guard from the main Kanalet area with just boomerang.</p>
<h3>Itemless Fisher</h3>
<p>Face the fisherman from the left, get within 4 pixels (a range, not exact) of his left side, hold up, and mash a until you get the textbox.</p>
<h3>Corner Walking</h3>
<p>You can barely make it over a pit by hugging a corner if you're careful.</p>
<br />
<br />
<h2>Glitched Logic</h2>
<p>There are a few important glitches that open up a lot of potential with a few items. You are also expected to know all of the hard logic strats.</p>
<br />
<h3>Menu Buffering</h3>
<p>Uses for this will be explained as they are needed, but menu buffering is a prerequisite for some of these glitches.</p>
<p>The main menu to buffer with is the pause menu: you pause, unpause, and while the screen is still fading back in, you hold the input for the next frame, whether that's pause again, an item, or movement. Pause buffers advance the game exactly one frame at a time.</p>
<h3>Bomb Triggers</h3>
<p>Due to an oversight in how bomb arrows are handled, when you somehow place two bombs at once, you can trigger an on-screen event, those being heart-piece pick-ups, Papahl on the cliff, song triggers, and probably more: check the logic file for info on where.</p>
<h4>Pulling off a bomb trigger:</h4>
<p>Bomb triggers can be done on a screen transition, or in a pit. For screen bomb triggers, you have to be facing vertically (either upwards or downwards), and be on the very edge of the screen. You pause buffer a bomb, vertical movement (all cases), and horizontal movement (on horizontal screens). You then use the screen transition as a buffer for another pause, and then use that buffer for a bomb.</p>
<p>Pit bomb triggers are considerably easier. You find a pit, and buffer two consecutive bombs; or just hit the bomb button really fast, without bothering with buffers.</p>
<p>You should use two bombs on a successful bomb trigger.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QyMJgp3uPro">This</a> is a decent enough video tutorial for bomb triggering.</p>
<h3>Jesus Jumps</h3>
<p>Jump onto a water tile, pause buffer until you see the splash from Link landing, and buffer feather on the next frame. On screen transitions, you do a jesus jump before the transition, go to the next screen, buffer until you see a splash, and then do a new jesus jump.</p>
<h3>Pit Buffering</h3>
<p>You can cross pits from above by walking onto it and pause buffering over and over. When the game makes Link fall, he moves down a few pixels, but buffering allows you to stay alive. Glitched logic doesn't require you to cross more than one pit consecutively like this.</p>
<h3>Villa Buffering</h3>
<p>You can pit buffer downwards into a wall, and jump from that wall using feather to cross horizontal gaps.</p>
<h3>Hookshot Clips</h3>
<p>The three-rock formation in front of doorways can be clipped through with hookshot: you want to aim right below one of the horizontal rocks, and when you get it through that gap, it will grab the other side and pull you in. One-way; you'll have to Return Home once you get what's in there.</p>
<h3>Super Jumps</h3>
<p>Super Jumps are an exploit of the way ledges work, using wall clipping. They are difficult to explain, but easy to grasp: check out the first few minutes of <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WDImsV5kAdQ">this video</a>.</p>
<p>It is possible to pull off a super jump with only feather: you wall clip, walk in the direction you want to go for one frame, to change your direction while still being clipped, and then jump, hold away from desired direction for about a second or two, then holding towards your desired direction, near the peak of your jump.</p>
<h3>Sideways Block Pushes</h3>
<p>You align yourself on the pixel in-between two blocks, and then walk towards it like you were pushing it: the game will push one of the blocks sideways instead.</p>
<h3>Richard's Maze early/Gold Leaf skip</h3>
<p>You can pit buffer into Richard's maze from above, using the left bush. You then pause buffer until you clip into the bottom of the screen, and move down to enter the maze. You can exit by doing the same thing on the tile one left of where you land.</p>
<h3>Shaq Jumping</h3>
<p>You back up against a wall, and push the direction away from the wall after reaching it to super jump. See <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=k_HRYR_pp8s">here</a>.</p>
<h3>D8 Walk-through</h3>
<p>Once the head breaks, you can walk through it by going right under it and holding up. Skips any weapon requirement for D8 entry.</p>
<br />

<h3>Congratulations!</h3>
<p>Now you know how to play the harder logic levels. I am not explaining hell logic: there should be an explanation somewhere in the <a href="https://discord.gg/XTw7X2G">discord</a>.</p>
