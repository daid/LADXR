<h1>So, you want to play non-casual?</h1>
<h5>(A brief guide to the tricks used in both Hard and Glitched, written by <a href="https://github.com/foxsouns">fox</a>.)</h5>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>You'll want to familarize yourself with the <a href="https://github.com/daid/LADXR/tree/master/logic">logic files</a> of the randomizer: the comments are typically descriptive enough to figure out what trick you are supposed to use. And, if you aren't already, I highly recommend playing on <a href="http://ladxr.daid.eu/latest/">latest</a>. The benefits overweigh the downsides.</p>
<h2>Hard Logic</h2>
<p>Hard logic is basically Normal logic, except, well, a little harder! Not to worry: there isn't a whole lot to cover.</p>
<h3>Boots Jumping</h3>
<p>There are several places where you can reach hard-to-reach areas using the longer jump provided by equiping both boots and feather, dashing with boots, then jumping.</p>
<h3>Clipping</h3>
<p>At the corner of a block, it is possible to walk into the wall a few pixels more than usual, and continue walking with those extra pixels. There are a few cases where you can bypass enemies or reach hard-to-reach areas with those extra pixels.</p>
<h3>Hookshot tricks</h3>
<p>There are a few places where you can get over pits with some tricky uses of hookshot.</p>
