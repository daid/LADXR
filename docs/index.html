<h1>LADXR: The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX - Randomizer</h1>

<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>LADXR is an item (and entrance) randomizer for the North American/English (revision-0/v1.0) ROM of "The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX".</p>
<p><em>What does this do?</em> It changes the locations of items in order to provide a new experience to the game.</p>
<p>It ensures the game is still beatable by checking if all locations can still be reached, but progress will (usually) not be linear: you will have to find your own path.</p>
<p>The goal of this randomizer is to create a new experience, both glitchless and bugless (except those caused by the player). Normal gameplay should not introduce any bugs, and it can be experienced like the normal game.</p>

<h2>Feature list:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nearly every item is able to be shuffled, depending on your selected settings.</li>
<li>Dungeon items are shuffled within their respective dungeon by default, but can be included with the rest of the pool (via keysanity, and the such).</li>
<li>Dungeon keys (Tail Key, Angler Key, Face Key, Bird Key and Slime Key) and the Golden Leaves are also shuffled into the pool of items.</li>
<li>The trading sequence and the date with Marin are now optional. Each part of the trading sequence will give you an item if you show them what they need.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Play</h2>

<p>You can use the following webpages to generate a custom randomized ROM for you.</p>
<p><a href="http://ladxr.daid.eu/latest/"><strong>Latest: </strong>The latest and greatest version, fresh off of the master branch. Can change at any moment, and may be unstable, but most of the time it works great.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://ladxr.daid.eu/v10/"><strong>V0.10: </strong>Current stable version. Many bugfixes from v0.9, also adds a few more options.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://ladxr.daid.eu/v09/"><strong>V0.9: </strong>Long time in the work compared to V0.8, many new options, newer web interface. Entrance randomization contains bugs, and should be avoided.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://ladxr.daid.eu/v08/"><strong>V0.8: </strong>Combining boss shuffle with heart container randomization is buggy. Various small logic bugs, less options than v0.9.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://ladxr.daid.eu/v07/"><strong>V0.7: </strong>A few small logic bugs, far less options.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://ladxr.daid.eu/v06/"><strong>V0.6: </strong>Whole bunch of small bugs, softlocking due to bad key logic is possible, many newer features not available.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://ladxr.daid.eu/v05/"><strong>V0.5: </strong>Contains a few logic bugs, newer versions are recommended.</a></p>
<p>(Older versions are too unstable to be useful and are not recommended, as seed generation was not stable)</p>
