<h1>LADXR: Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX - Randomizer</h1>

<h2>What is this?</h2>
<ul>
<p>This is a randomizer for the Game Boy Color game The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX</p>
<p>What does this do? It changes the locations of items in the game to give a new way to play the game.</p>
<p>It ensures the game is still beatable, by checking if all locations can still be reached. But no guarantee that you progress from Dungeon to Dungeon, you will have to find your own path.</p>
<p>The goal of this randomizer is to create a new experience, which does not show any glitches or bugs (except when you use a bug/glitch yourself). Normal gameplay should not introduce any bugs, and it can be experienced like the normal game.</p>
<p>Feature list:
<li>All contents in chests are shuffled.</li>
<li>The shield given by Tarin is shuffled.</li>
<li>Heart Pieces and seashells not found in chests can be shuffled optionally.</li>
<li>Small Keys, Nightmare Keys, Maps, Compasses, and Stone Beaks are shuffled within their respective dungeons. Keysanity will allow them to be shuffled anywhere in the game.</li>
<li>Dungeon keys (Tail Key, Angler Key, Face Key, Bird Key and Slime Key) and the Golden Leaves are also shuffled into the pool of items.</li>
<li>Completing the trading sequence is not required to beat the game. (The book that tells you the path through the Wind Fish's Egg is readable without the Magnifying Lens) This also means that taking Marin on a date isn't required, either.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Play</h2>

<p>You can use the following webpages to generate a custom randomized ROM for you.</p>
<p><a href="http://ladxr.daid.eu/latest/"><strong>Latest: </strong>Latest greatest version, can change at any moment and might be unstable, but most of the time works great.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://ladxr.daid.eu/v09/"><strong>V0.9: </strong>Current stable version. Long time in the work compared to V0.8, many new options, newer web interface. Recommended. Entrance randomization contains bugs and should be avoided.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://ladxr.daid.eu/v08/"><strong>V0.8: </strong>Combining boss shuffle with heart container randomization is buggy. Various small logic bugs, less options then 0.9.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://ladxr.daid.eu/v07/"><strong>V0.7: </strong>Older version, few small logic bugs, much less options.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://ladxr.daid.eu/v06/"><strong>V0.6: </strong>Whole bunch of small bugs, softlocking due to bad key logic is possible, many newer features not available.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://ladxr.daid.eu/v05/"><strong>V0.5: </strong>Contains a few logic bugs, newer versions are recommended.</a></p>
<p>(Older versions are too unstable to be useful and are not recommended, as seed generation was not stable)</p>
